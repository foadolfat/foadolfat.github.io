      <h1>Time Travelling Picture</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/black-hole-image-makes-history">
        NASA's picture of the blackhole</a> at the center of the Messier 87 galaxy 
        was taken at a distance of 50 million light years away. That means the black hole
        looked like it does in the picture, approximately <strong>50 million years</strong> 
        ago. Effectively, NASA took a picture of the distant past.</p>
